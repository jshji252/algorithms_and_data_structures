## Recursive Functions

What iterative solution can achieve, recursive funcs can too, but in a more elegant way!

## Idea

Kind of like the Induction in maths

1. Base case - the condition where the recursion should STOP.
2. Recursive case - the condition where we inspect the 'next case'. This should draw us closer to Base Case.

## Warnings

Stak.Over.Flow, of course!

1. Base case must be set - otherwise stack will overflow, which is like an infinite loop
2. Recursive case must bring us closer to the Base Case each step!
