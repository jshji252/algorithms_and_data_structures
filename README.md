## Algorithms!

So I enjoy solving algorithm questions from time to time on websites such as HackerRank, Codewars, and so on.

## Why?

- Personal projects are often too small and it is not so often that it requires an 'efficient algorithm'
- On the other hand, these algorithm questions are probably too artificial to be directly useful in real-world coding, but still, doing these questions make me always want to code as efficiently as possible. It's a good habit!
- Reading other people's solutions are extremely helpful!
- Sometimes if I don't code in one language for a long time, it's easy to forget the syntax and some language-specific things. And I found it useful to occasionally do queestions in languages that I haven't used for a while.
- For fun!

## What's this for?

I wanted to keep some of the codes for future reference, either by me or by others, because they were really well-written (as in efficient, or clever, or just beautiful!).
