## Algorithms and Data Structures
This repo contains:
- Data Structures : collection of any data structures, and algorithms that I have studied.
- Other Algorithms : collection of other algorithms which I usually encountered while solving algorithm questions on websites such as HackerRank, Codewars, and so on.

## Why?
Data Structures:
- After doing lots of algorithm questions, I learnt it the hard way that I really need to think about data structure.

Competitive Coding:
- Personal projects are often too small to need an 'efficient algorithm', thus it's useful to practice on those websites
- Reading other people's solutions are extremely helpful, even if I was able to solve the problem
- A good way to practice a langauge that I haven't used for a while
- Fun!
