### Sorting

Sorting is important for a number of reasons. Binary search, for example, only works with a sorted set of data. There are many different sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sort

The easiest and most straight forward sorting algorithm. When the data is already in a relatively sorted status, it can be useful. Notably, it requires very low space complexity of O(1) (constant).

1. Compare neighbouring values;
2. Repeat the following until sorted:
   1. If not in the order yet, swap
   2. If in order, move on
